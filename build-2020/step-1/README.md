# Surface Duo + Xamarin step 1

**Microsoft Build 2020**

This code sample was used in the Microsoft Build 2020 session [_How to bring your Android apps to Surface Duo with Xamarin_](http://aka.ms/M365sk123).

The session begins with the code for this [quickstart documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/get-started/quickstarts/multi-page). It's been copied from the [Xamarin samples GitHub](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/GetStarted/Notes/MultiPage) to this folder for reference.

In the session, this sample is used to test how the app works on the [Surface Duo emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/android/get-duo-sdk).

Once the sample has been shown to work, go to [step 2](../step-2/) to see how drag-and-drop can be implemented for Android.
